When the API key is created, the default *notifications* set there, sent to my app hook: ``http://208.68.38.174:8000/buyme/hook/9999999911111263534/`` ...  
... just doesn't work. It never gets called.

I solve it by setting individual notifications when creating the callback.
  
Perhaps this influences the default callback, so that the above default notification stops working? Dunno.
